
Snake 8

It's Snake Designer's Turn
The snake will initially consist of one piece - the head.
It is necessary to transfer the coordinates of the snake to the constructor.
It is necessary:
a) pass to the constructor the coordinates of the snake's head (x and y)
b) create in it the first “snake piece” (head) and add it to the sections collection.
c) isAlive set to true
d) do not forget to initialize the sections variable in the constructor. In null, you don’t add much!
d) create and implement the int getX () method. The method should return the X coordinate of the snake's head.
f) create and implement the int getY () method. The method should return the Y coordinate of the snake's head.
g) still add the move () method to the class - it will be useful to us later.
h) the created constructor must be beaten publicly.
